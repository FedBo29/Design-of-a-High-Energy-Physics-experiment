# Tracking-detector
This is a Monte Carlo simulation of events generated after a particle collision.   
This project was an assignment for the exam in Nuclear Physics "Numeric Analysis and Simulation Technology" at University of Turin.

The task was to generate, simulate and reconstruct the signal produced after a proton-proton collision.
The system simulated is a tracking system composed by the beam pipe and two layers. 
Then, there are the analysis of this tracking system to evaluete its Efficiency.

All the work has been done by Federico Bonaldo and Irene Amateis.
